                HTML5 can be imagined as a building supported by three main columns: HTML, CSS and Javascript. We have already studied the elements
                built-in HTML and new properties that make CSS the ideal tool for designers. Now is the time to reveal what
                 can be considered as one of the strongest pillars of this specification: Javascript. Javascript is an interpreted language
                 used for multiple purposes but only considered as a plugin until now.<br><br> One of the innovations that helped change the
                  The way we see Javascript was the development of new rendering engines, created to speed up code processing.
                  <br><br> . The key to the most successful engines was to transform Javascript code into machine code to achieve execution speeds
                  similar to those found in desktop applications. This improved capacity allowed to overcome old limitations of
                  performance and confirm the Javascript language as the best option for the web. To take advantage of this promising platform of
                  work offered by new browsers, Javascript was expanded in relation to portability and integration. At the same time, interface
                   Application Programming APIs (APIs) were built-in by default in every browser to assist the language in functions
                   elementals. <br><br>These new APIs (such as Web Storage, Canvas, and others) are interfaces to browser-embedded libraries. The idea
                   is to make powerful functions available through simple and standard programming techniques, expanding the scope of the
                   language and facilitating the creation of useful programs for the web. In this chapter we are going to study how to incorporate Javascript
                   inside our HTML documents and we will see the recent additions to this language with the intention of preparing us for
                   the rest of the book.<br><br>
 
 
 
  <strong>IMPORTANT :</strong><br>Our approach to JavaScript in this book is introductory. As with CSS, we're just going to go over the techniques that
  we need to understand to implement the examples in the next chapters. We will work on complex topics, but only using a minimum
   of code required to take advantage of these new features. If you need to expand your knowledge of this language, visit
    our website and follow the links to this chapter.<br><br>
 



     
     <span class="tito">-  Incorporating Javascript     : </span>  <br>

     Following the same guidelines as CSS, there are three techniques for embedding Javascript code within HTML. However, just like
     that in CSS, only the inclusion of external files is recommended to use in HTML5. <br><br>

<strong>IMPORTANT :</strong> <br>In this chapter we introduce new features as well as basic techniques needed to understand the
examples from the book. If you are familiar with this information feel free to skip the parts you already know.<br><br>

 <span class="tito">- Online  : </span>  <br>
 This is a simple technique to insert Javascript into our document that takes advantage of attributes available on HTML elements.
 These attributes are event handlers that execute code according to the user's action. More event handlers
 used are, in general, those related to the mouse, such as onclick, onMouseOver, or onMouseOut. However, we will find
  websites that implement keyboard and window events, executing actions after a key is pressed or something else
  condition on the browser window changes (for example, onload or onfocus).<br><br>

  Listing 4-1. Inline Javascript. <br><br>
                 
  Using the onclick event handler in Listing 4-1, some code is executed each time the user clicks with
  the mouse over the text that says “Click”. What the onclick handler is saying is something like: “when someone
   click on this element execute this code” and the code in this case is a predefined function in Javascript that
    shows a small window with the message “clicked!”.
Try changing the onclick handler to onMouseOver, for example, and you'll see how the code is executed just by hovering over it.
about the element. The use of Javascript within HTML tags is allowed in HTML5, but for the same reasons as in CSS, this
practice class is not recommended.<br><br> HTML code is unnecessarily extended and difficult to maintain and update. In addition,
code spread over the entire document complicates building useful applications. New methods and techniques were
developed to reference HTML elements and register event handlers without having to use inline code.
We'll come back to this and learn more about events and event handlers later in this chapter.<br><br>

<strong>Do it yourself : </strong> <br>Copy the code from Listing 4-1 and the following codes studied in this chapter into
a new HTML file. Open the file in your browser to try each example. <br><br>

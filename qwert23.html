                If you have any prior programming experience, or just followed this chapter from the beginning, you'll find it easy.
                recognize the amount of code needed to perform simple tasks. Now imagine all the work you would have to do to build
                a database system from scratch, or generate complex graphics on the screen, or create an image manipulation application,
                 to name a few. Javascript is as powerful as any other development language right now. And for the same reason that
                  professional programming languages ​​have libraries to create graphic elements, 3D engines for video games or interfaces for
                  accessing databases, Javascript has APIs to help programmers deal with complex activities.<br> <br>
               HTML5 introduces several APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to provide access to powerful libraries from simple code.
               JavaScript. The potential of these incorporations is so important that they will soon become our object of study. Let's see
                quickly its features to get a perspective of what we will find in the rest of the book. next is
                just an introduction, later we will study each of these technologies in greater depth. <br> <br> 



  <span class="tito">- Canvas   : </span>  <br>           
  
  Canvas is a graphics API that provides a basic but powerful drawing surface. This is the most wonderful and promising API of
  all. The ability to generate and print graphics on the screen, create animations or manipulate images and videos (combined with the
  remaining functionality of HTML5) opens the doors for what we can imagine. Canvas generates an image with pixels that are created
   and manipulated by functions and methods provided specifically for this purpose. <br> <br>

  <span class="tito">- Drag and Drop : </span>  <br>
  
  Drag and Drop incorporates the possibility of dragging and dropping elements on the screen as we would commonly do it in applications of
    desk. Now, with a few lines of code, we can make an element available for drag and drop.
    inside another element on the screen. These elements may include not only graphics but also text, links, files or
    data in general.<br> <br> 


   <span class="tito">-  Geolocation   : </span>  <br>

   Geolocation is used to establish the physical location of the device used to access the application. There are several methods
   to access this information, from network signals to the Global Positioning System (GPS). Returned values ​​include
   latitude and longitude, making it possible to integrate this API with others such as Google Maps, for example, or access information from
    specific localization for the construction of practical applications that work in real time. <br> <br>

   <span class="tito">- Storage    : </span>  <br>
   
   Two APIs were created for data storage purposes: Web Storage and Indexed Database. Basically, these APIs transfer
   responsibility for the storage of data from the server to the user's computer, but in the case of Web Storage and its attribute
   sessionStorage, this addition also increases the level of control and the efficiency of web applications. Web Storage contains two
    important attributes that are sometimes considered APIs themselves: sessionStorage and localStorage.<br><br>
   The sessionStorage attribute is responsible for maintaining consistency over the duration of a web page session and preserving
    temporary information such as the contents of a shopping cart, securing the data in case of accident or misuse (when the
    application is opened in a second window, for example). On the other hand, the localStorage attribute allows us to store
    extensive information content on the user's computer. The information stored is persistent and does not expire, except
     for security reasons. Both sessionStorage and localStorage attributes replace the old cookie system function
      and they were created to overcome their limitations. <br><br>


      The second API, grouped within the storage APIs but independent
      the rest is Indexed Database. The elementary function of a database system is to store indexed information.
      Web Storage API works on the storage of large or small amounts of information, temporary or permanent data,
       but not structured data. This is a possibility only available for database systems and the reason for existence
        of this API. Indexed Database is a replacement for the SQL Database Web API.<br><br>
         Due to disagreements about the standard
        appropriate to use, neither of these two APIs has been fully adopted. In fact, at this very moment, the development
         of the Web SQL Database API (which had been received with open arms at the beginning), has been cancelled. Because
         the Indexed Database API, also known as IndexedDB, looks more promising and is supported by Microsoft, the
         Firefox and Google developers, will be our choice for this book. However, always keep in mind that
          new implementations of SQL are currently being considered and the situation could change in the near future.<br><br>

          <span class="tito">- File    : </span>  <br>
          
          Under the File heading, HTML5 offers several APIs intended to operate with files. There are currently three available: File, File:
          Directories & System, and File:Writer. Thanks to this group of APIs, we can now create and process files on the user's computer. <br><br>
         
         Communication Some APIs have a common denominator that allows us to group them together. This is the case for XMLHttpRequest Level 2, Cross
          Document Messaging, and Web Sockets. The Internet has always been about communications, of course, but some unresolved issues
           They made the process complicated and sometimes impossible. Three specific problems were addressed in HTML5: the API used for the
            creation of Ajax applications was not complete and complicated to implement across different browsers, communication
            between unrelated applications was non-existent, and there was no way to establish effective two-way communication to access
             to information on the server in real time.<br><br>

             The first problem was solved with the development of XMLHttpRequest Level 2. XMLHttpRequest was the API used for a long time to create
             Ajax applications, codes that access the server without reloading the web page. Level 2 of this API incorporates new events, provides
             more functionality (with events that allow you to track the process), portability (the API is now standard), and accessibility
             (using cross requests, from one domain to another). The solution for the second problem was the creation of Cross Document Messaging. <br><br>
             This API helps developers to overcome existing limitations to communicate different boxes and windows with each other.
              Now
              secure communication across different applications is offered by this API using messages. The solution for the last
              of the problems listed above is Web Sockets. Its purpose is to provide the necessary tools for the creation of
              network applications that work in real time (for example, chat rooms). The API allows applications to get and send
               information to the server in short periods of time, making real-time applications possible for the web.<br><br>

   


   <span class="tito">-  Web Workers   : </span>  <br>
   
   This is a unique API that expands Javascript to a new level. This language is not a multitasking language, which means that only
   can take care of only one task at a time. Web Workers provide the ability to process code behind the scenes (executed separately
    from the rest), without interfering with the activity on the web page and the main code. Thanks to this API Javascript can now run
     multiple tasks at the same time. <br><br>


   <span class="tito">-   History    : </span>  <br>
 
   Ajax changed the way users interact with web sites and applications. And the browsers were not ready for
   this situation. History was implemented to adapt modern applications to the way browsers keep track of
   user activity. This API incorporates techniques to artificially generate URLs for each step in the process, offering the
   possibility of returning to previous states of the application using standard navigation procedures.<br><br>
  
  
  <span class="tito">-  Offline   : </span>  <br>
  
  Even today, with Internet access everywhere we go, going offline is still possible. portable devices are
   they find everywhere, but not the signal to establish communication. And desktop computers can also leave us
   disconnected in the most critical moments. With the combination of HTML attributes, Javascript-driven events, and
    text, Offline will allow applications to work online or offline, depending on the user's situation.<br><br>

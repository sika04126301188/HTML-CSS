            <h1 class="titelo">_ Traditional box model  : </h1> 
            <p class="parami">

                It all started with boards. The tables were the elements that unintentionally became the ideal tool used by
                developers to create and organize content boxes in
               the screen. This can be considered the first box model on the web. Boxes were created by expanding cells and
                combining rows of cells, columns of cells and entire tables, one on top of another or even nested. when the sites
                websites grew and became more and more complex this practice began to present serious problems related to the
                 size and maintenance of the code needed to create them. These initial problems necessitated what is now
                 we see as a natural practice: the division between structure and presentation.<br><br> Using div tags and CSS styles was
                 possible to override the tables function and effectively separate the HTML structure from the presentation.
                 With div elements and CSS we can create boxes on the screen, position these boxes to one side or the other and
                      give them a specific size, color or border among other characteristics. CSS provides specific properties
                      that allow us to organize the boxes according to our wishes. These properties are powerful enough
                       as to create a box model that became what we know today as a Box Model
                       Traditional.<br><br> Some deficiencies in this model kept the tables alive for some time,
                        but the main developers, influenced by the success of Ajax implementations
                        and a huge number of new interactive apps gradually went back to div tags
                            and CSS styles into a standard. Finally the Traditional Box Model was adopted on a large scale.  <br><br>
                .

              


        
                 <span class="tito">- Template  : </span> <br>
                 In Chapter 1 we built an HTML5 template. This template has all the necessary elements to provide
                 structure to our document, but some details must be added to apply the CSS styles and the Model
                  Traditional Box. This model needs to group boxes together to order them horizontally. Because the
                  entire body content is created from boxes, we need to add a div element to group them, center them
                      and give them a specific size. The new template will look like this:<br><br>
                       <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_33.png"><br>
                       Listing 2-25. New HTML5 template ready for CSS styling. Listing 2-25 <br><br>
                 
                 
                       provides a new template ready to receive CSS styles. Two important changes can be distinguished by comparing
                       this code with the one in Listing 1-18 in Chapter 1. The first is that several labels have now been identified with
                       the id and class attributes. This means that we can reference a specific element from the CSS rules with the
                        value of its id attribute or we can modify several elements at the same time using the value of its class attribute.
                        The second change made to the old template is the addition of the div element mentioned above.<br><br>
                             This div was identified with the id=”group” attribute and value, and is closed at the end of the body with
                                 the closing tag /div. This element is responsible for grouping all the other elements allowing us to
                                 apply the box model to the body and designate its horizontal position, as we will see later.  <br><br>
                   
                    
                   


<strong>do it yourself :</strong><br> Compare the code in Listing 1-18 in Chapter 1 with the code in Listing 2-25 in this
chapter and place the opening and closing tags of the div element used to group the rest. Also
    check which elements are now identified with the id attribute and which with the class attribute. Confirm that the
    id attribute values ​​are unique for each tag. You will also need to replace the code in the created HTML file
    above by Listing 2-25 to apply the following CSS styles. With the HTML document finished it is time to work
    in our styles file.<br><br>
    
           
   
        
         <span class="tito">- universal selector :</span><br>

        
         Let's start with some basic rules that will help us provide consistency to the design: <br><br>
         
         * { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; } <br>
         Listing 2-26. General CSS rule.<br><br>
         
         Normally, for most elements, we need to customize the margins or just keep them to a minimum.
         Some default elements have margins that are non-zero and in most cases too wide.
         As we go through the creation of our design we will find that most
         of the elements used must have a margin of 0 pixels. To avoid having to constantly repeat styles,
         we can use the universal selector.<br><br> The first rule in our CSS file, presented in Listing 2-26, ensures that
         that every element will have an inner and outer margin of 0 pixels. From now on we will only need to modify the margins
          of the elements that we want to be greater than zero.<br><br>
         
         
    
                    
          <strong>Basic concepts :</strong> <br>Remember that in HTML each element is considered as a box. the margin
          is actually the space around the element, the one outside the border of that box (the padding style,
           on the other hand, it is the space around the content of the element but inside its borders, such as the space between the title
           and the border of the virtual box formed by the h1 element that contains that title). <br><br>Margin size can be defined
               by specific sides of the element or all its sides at once. The style margin: 0px in our example sets
                a 0 or null margin for each element of the box. If the size had been specified as 5 pixels, for example,
                the box would have a space 5 pixels wide all the way around. This means that the box would be separated from
                its neighbors by 5 pixels. We will return to this topic later in this chapter. <br><br>

            <strong>Do it yourself :</strong><br> We must write all the necessary rules to style our template
            in a CSS file. The file has already been included in the HTML code by means of the link tag, so the only thing that
            All we have to do is create an empty text file with our favorite text editor, save it with the name mystyles.
            css and then copy inside it the rule from Listing 2-26 and all the ones below. 
            <br><br>

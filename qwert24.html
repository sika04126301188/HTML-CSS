                HTML5 was developed to expand the web using a set of standard technologies that every browser can understand and process.
                And it was created to provide all the tools a developer needs. In fact, HTML5 was conceptualized not to depend on
                 third party technologies. But for one reason or another we will always need extra help. Before the appearance of HTML5,
                  Various Javascript libraries were developed to overcome the limitations of currently available technologies. Some of
                   these libraries had specific purposes (from processing and validating forms to generating and manipulating data).
                   graphics).<br> <br> 
     
                   Some have become extremely popular and others are almost impossible for independent developers to imitate.
                   (as is the case with Google Maps). Even when future implementations provide better methods or functions, programmers
                    they will always find an easier way to deal with a given issue. Libraries developed by third parties that facilitate
                     Complicated tasks will always be alive and growing in number. These libraries are not part of HTML5 but they are a part
                     of the web and some of them are currently used in successful websites and applications. Along with the rest of
                     the functions incorporated by this specification, improve Javascript and bring the latest technologies closer to the
                     general public.<br> <br> 
               
        <span class="tito">- jQuery  : </span>  <br>         
         
        This is the most popular web bookstore available these days. The jQuery library is free and was designed to simplify creation
        of modern websites. It makes it easy to select HTML elements, create animations and effects, and also handle events and help
        to implement Ajax in our applications. The jQuery library is in a small file that can be downloaded
         from www.jquery.<br><br>
         com and then include in our documents using the tag
         script. It provides a simple API that anyone can learn and quickly apply to their projects. Once the file provided
         by jQuery is included in our document, we are ready to take advantage of the simple methods built in by the library and
         convert our static website into a modern and practical application. jQuery has the advantage of providing support for older browsers.
         and makes everyday tasks simple. It can be used in conjunction with HTML5 or as a simple way to replace HTML5 functions in
         browsers that are not prepared for this technology. <br><br>
        
        
 <span class="tito">- Google Maps   : </span>  <br>    
 
 Accessible through Javascript (and other technologies), Google Maps is a complex and unique set of tools that allows us to develop
 any mapping service for the web that we can imagine. Google has become the leader in this class of services and through the
 Google Maps technology provides access to an extremely accurate and detailed map of the world. Using this API we can find places
  locations, calculate distances, find popular sites, or even get a view of the selected place as if we were
  presents. Google Maps is free and available to all developers. Different versions of the API can be found at:
  code.google.com/apis/maps/. <br> <br> 
 


  <span class="tito">- Quick reference : </span> <br>
   
  In HTML5, Javascript was improved by adding new features and incorporating native methods.<br> <br>
  
  
  <span class="tito">- Elements : </span> <br>
 
 script This element now has Javascript as the default language. The type attribute is no longer required.<br> <br>


 
 <span class="tito">- Selectors : </span> <br>
  
 The ability to select a document element dynamically from Javascript code has become essential for any
 Web Application. New methods have been incorporated for this purpose.<br> <br>






 <span class="tito">- getElementsByClassName : </span> <br>
 
 This selector allows us to find elements in the document by means of the value of their class attribute. It is an addition to the already
 known getElementsByTagName and getElementById.<br> <br>


 <span class="tito">- querySelector(selectors) : </span> <br>
 
 This method uses CSS selectors to reference elements in the document. Selectors are declared in parentheses.
 This method can be combined with others to build more specific references. Returns only the first element found. <br> <br>









 <span class="tito">- querySelectorAll(selectors) : </span> <br>
 
  This method is similar to querySelector() but returns all elements that match the specified selectors.<br> <br>


  <span class="tito">- Events : </span> <br>
  
 The relevance of events in web applications motivated the standardization of methods already available in leading browsers.<br> <br>


 <span class="tito">- addEventListener(event, handler, catch) : </span> <br>
 
 This method is used to add a listener for an event. The method receives three values: the name of the event, the function that
  will respond to the event, and a boolean value (true or false) indicating the order of execution of various events fired at the event.
  Same time. Normally the third attribute is set to false.<br> <br>


 <span class="tito">- removeEventListener(event, handler, catch) : </span> <br>

  This method is used to remove a listener for an event by disabling the handler. The required values ​​are the same
   than those used for addEventListener(). <br> <br>


 
  <span class="tito">- APIs : </span> <br>
 
  The scope of JavaScript has been expanded with a set of powerful libraries accessible through interfaces called APIs. <br> <br>





  <span class="tito">- Canvas : </span> <br>

  This API is a drawing API, specifically for creating and manipulating graphics. It uses predefined Javascript methods to operate. <br> <br>
 
 
  <span class="tito">- Drag and Drop : </span> <br>
  
   This API makes dragging and dropping elements with the mouse on the screen possible on the web as well.<br> <br>
 
 
   <span class="tito">- Geolocation : </span> <br>
   
   This API is intended to provide access to information corresponding to the physical location of the device that is
    accessing the application. You can return data such as latitude and longitude using different mechanisms (such as information
    network or GPS). <br> <br>
 
 
   <span class="tito">- Web Storage : </span> <br>
  
  This API introduces two attributes to store data on the user's computer: sessionStorage and localStorage. The attribute
   sessionStorage allows developers to track user activity by storing information that
   it will be available in each instance of the application for the duration of the session. The localStorage attribute, on the other hand,
   offers developers a storage area, created for each application, that can hold several megabytes of
   information, thus preserving information and data on the user's computer in a persistent manner. <br> <br>
 
 
  <span class="tito">- Indexed Database : </span> <br>
 
  This API adds the ability to work with user-side databases. The system was developed independently
  of previous technologies and provides a database for web applications. The database is stored on the computer
  of the user, the data is persistent and, of course, unique to the application that created it.<br> <br>
 
 
  
  <span class="tito">- File : </span> <br>
   
  This is a group of APIs developed to provide the ability to read, write, and process user files. <br> <br>











  <span class="tito">- XMLHttpRequest Level 2 : </span> <br>

  This API is an enhancement to the old XMLHttpRequest intended for building Ajax applications. Includes new methods
   to control the progress of the operation and perform cross requests (from different origins). <br> <br>
 
 
  <span class="tito">- Cross Document Messaging : </span> <br>
 
  This API introduces a new communication technology that allows applications to communicate with each other through
   different frames or windows.<br> <br>
 
 
  <span class="tito">- WebSockets : </span> <br>
  
  This API provides a two-way communication mechanism between clients and servers to generate applications in real time.
  like chat rooms or online games. <br> <br>
 
 
  <span class="tito">- Web Workers : </span> <br>
 
  This API powers Javascript by allowing code to be processed behind the scenes, separately from code.
   main, without interrupting the normal activity of the web page, incorporating the capacity of multitasking to this language.<br> <br>
 
 
   <span class="tito">- History : </span> <br>
   
   This API provides the alternative of embedding each step in an application's process within the history of
   browser navigation.<br> <br>
 
 
   <span class="tito">- Offline : </span> <br>
    
    This API aims to keep applications functional even when the device is disconnected from the network.<br> <br>

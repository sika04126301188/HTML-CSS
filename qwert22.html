            <p class="parami">
           
                
                As we discussed earlier, Javascript code is normally executed after the user performs some action. These actions and
                other events are processed by event handlers and Javascript functions associated with them. There are three different ways of
                register an event for an HTML element: we can add a new attribute to the element, register an event handler as a
                element property or use the new standard addEventListener() method.<br> <br> 
               




 <span class="tito">- Basic concepts : </span>  <br>
 
 In Javascript user actions are called events. When the user performs an action, such as a mouse click or pressure
 of a key, a specific event for each action and each element is fired. In addition to the events produced by the users, there are
  also other events fired by the system (for example, the load event that fires when the document is fully loaded).
   These events are handled by code or functions. The code that responds to the event is called a handler. When we register a handler
    what we do is define how our application will respond to a particular event. After the standardization of the method
    addEventListener(), this procedure is usually called "event listener", and what we do to prepare the code that
     will respond to that event is to “add a listener” to a particular element.<br><br>


 <span class="tito">- Online event handlers  : </span>  <br>
 We already used this technique in the code in Listing 4-1 by including the onclick attribute on the p element (review this code to verify
 How does it apply). It is simply a matter of using the attributes provided by HTML to register events for a particular element.
  This is a deprecated technique but still extremely useful and practical in some circumstances, especially when we need to do
   quick modifications for testing. <br><br>


    <span class="tito">- Event handlers as properties : </span>  <br>

    To avoid the complications of the inline technique, we must register the events from the Javascript code. Wearing
    Javascript selectors we can reference the HTML element and assign the event handler we want to it as if it were a property.
     In the code in Listing 4-2 you will find this technique in practice. Two event handlers were assigned as properties
      to different elements. The onload event handler was registered for the window using the window.onload construct, and
      the onclick event handler was registered for the first p element found in the document with the line of code
          document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0].onclick.<br><br>


       <span class="tito">- Basic concepts : </span>  <br>
       Event handler names are constructed by adding the prefix on to the event name. For example, the name of the
       event handler for the click event is onclick. When we are talking about onclick we usually refer to the
       code that will be executed when the click event occurs. Before HTML5, this was the only technique available to use
       event handlers from Javascript that worked in all browsers. Some browser manufacturers were
        developing their own systems, but nothing was adopted by all until the new standard was declared. for this
        This is why we recommend using this technique for compatibility reasons, but we don't suggest it for your HTML5 applications.<br><br>

         <span class="tito">-  The addEventListener() method : </span> <br>
         
         The addEventListener() method is the ideal technique and the one that is considered standard by the HTML5 specification. This method
          has three arguments: the name of the event, the function to be executed, and a boolean value (false or true) that indicates how an
          event will be fired on overlapping elements.<br><br>
          <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_55.png"><br>
          Listing 4-8. Adding event listeners with addEventListener().<br><br>


          Listing 4-8 presents the same code as Listing 4-2 but now a listener was added for each event using the method
          addEventListener(). To organize the code in the click() function, we assign the reference to the element to a variable called
          element and then add the listener for the click event using that variable. The syntax of the addEventListener() method is
          the one shown in Listing 4-8. The first attribute is the name of the event. The second is the function to be executed, which
          it can be a reference to a function (as in this case) or an anonymous function. <br><br>The third attribute will specify, using true
          (true) or false, how multiple events will be fired. For example, if we are listening to the click event on two
          elements that are nested (one inside another), when the user clicks on these elements two click events
          they are fired in an order that depends on this value. If the attribute is declared true for one of the elements, then
          that event will be considered first and the other after. Normally the value false is the most suitable for most of the
           situations.<br><br>
         
          <span class="tito">- Basic concepts : </span> <br>
          
          Anonymous functions are functions that are dynamically declared and have no name (which is why they are called "anonymous"). This kind of
          functions are extremely useful in Javascript, they help us to organize the code and not overpopulate the global object with
          independent functions. We will use anonymous functions frequently in the following chapters.<br><br> Even when the results
          Applying this technique and the previous one are similar, addEventListener() allows us to add as many listeners as we need
          for the same element. This distinction gives addEventListener() an advantage over the rest, making it the technique
           ideal for HTML5 applications. Because events are the key to interactive websites and applications, many
           were added in the HTML5 specification. In future chapters we will study each of these new events and the
           environment in which they work.<br><br>

                As we made clear earlier, the new HTML specification (HTML5) doesn't just describe new HTML elements or the
                language itself. The web demands design and functionality, not just structural organization or definition of sections. In
                 In this new paradigm, HTML is presented together with CSS and Javascript as a single integrated tool. The function of
                 each technology has already been explained in previous chapters, as well as the new HTML elements responsible for the
                 document structure. Now is the time to analyze CSS, its relevance within this strategic union and its
                 influence on the presentation of HTML documents. Officially CSS has nothing to do with HTML5. <br><br>
                  
                 CSS is not part
                 of the specification and never was. This language is, in fact, a plugin developed to overcome the
                 limitations and reduce the complexity of HTML. In the beginning, attributes inside HTML tags provided styles
                 essential for each element, but as the language evolved, the writing of codes became more
                 complex and HTML by itself could no longer satisfy the demands of designers. <br><br>
                  
                 Consequently, CSS was soon
                  adopted as the way to separate structure from presentation. Since then, CSS has grown and gained importance,
                   but always developed in parallel, focused on the needs of designers and away from the development process.
                   HTML evolution. CSS version 3 follows the same path, but this time with a bigger compromise. The specification
                   of HTML5 was developed considering CSS in charge of the design.<br><br>
                   
                   Due to this consideration, the integration between
                   HTML and CSS is now vital for web development and this is the reason why every time we mention HTML5 as well
                   we are referring to CSS3, although officially they are two completely separate technologies. In this
                   At the moment the new features incorporated in CSS3 are being implemented and included along with the rest of the
                   specification in browsers compatible with HTML5. In this chapter, we are going to study basic concepts of CSS and the
                   new CSS3 techniques now available for presentation and structuring. <br><br>
                   
                   We will also learn how to use the new
                   selectors and pseudo classes that make it easier to select and identify HTM elements
Basic concepts: CSS is a language that works together with HTML to provide visual styles to the elements of the document, such as size,
 color, background, borders.  <br><br>

<strong>IMPORTANT : </strong><br>Right now the new CSS3 additions are being implemented in the latest versions of most browsers.
popular, but some of them are still experimental. For this reason, these new styles should be preceded by
 prefixes such as –moz- or -webkit  to be effectively interpreted. We will discuss this important matter later.

         <span class="tito">- Styles and structure  : </span> <br>

         Although each browser guarantees default styles for each of the HTML elements, these styles are not
         necessarily satisfy the requirements of each designer. They are usually very far from what
         we want for our websites. Designers and developers must often apply their own styles to get
         the organization and visual effect they really want.
         IMPORTANT: In this part of the chapter we are going to review CSS styles and explain some basic techniques to define the
          structure of a document. If you are already familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip the
           parts you already know.  <br><br>
         
           Block elements Regarding the structure, basically each browser orders the elements by default according to
           to its type: block (block) or inline (inline). This classification is associated with the way in which the elements are
            displayed on screen. <br><br>
         
          -*- Block elements are positioned one above the other down the page.  <br>

         -*- Inline elements are positioned side by side, next to each other on the same line, without any line breaks
         unless there is no more horizontal space to place them. <br><br>
         
         Almost all structural elements in our documents will be treated by browsers as elements.
         block by default. This means that each HTML element that represents a part of the visual organization
         (eg section, nav, header, footer, div) will be positioned below the previous one. In Chapter 1
             we create an HTML document with the intention of reproducing a traditional website. The design included bars
             horizontal and two columns in the middle. Due to the way browsers display these elements
             by default, the result on the Enter
        screen is far from our expectations. As soon as the HTML file with the code in Listing 1-18,
        Chapter 1, is opened in the browser, the wrong position on the screen of the two columns defined by the
         section and aside elements is clearly visible. One column is below the other instead of next to it.
             side, as it should. Each block (block) is displayed by default as wide as possible, as high
             as the information it contains and one on another<br><br>
         
              <strong>box models :</strong>  <br>
              To learn how we can create our own organization of screen elements, we must first understand
              how browsers process HTML code. Browsers treat each HTML element as a box. One page
              web is actually a group of boxes ordered following certain rules. These rules are established by styles
              provided by browsers or by designers using CSS. CSS has a default set of properties
              intended to override the styles provided by browsers and obtain the desired organization. these properties
               are not specific, they have to be combined to form rules that will later be used to group boxes and obtain
                the correct layout on the screen.<br><br> 
            
                The combination of these rules
                it is normally called a model or layout system. All these rules applied together constitute what is
                calls a box model. There is only one case model that is considered standard these days, and many others that are still being used.
                are in an experimental state. The valid and widely adopted model is the so-called Traditional Box Model,
                which has been used since the first version of CSS. Although this model has proven to be effective, some models
                experimental attempts to overcome its shortcomings, but the lack of consensus on the most suitable replacement still maintains
                This old model is still in force and most of the websites programmed in HTML5 continue to use it.

                     <span class="tito">- Style Basics :</span><br>

                     Before we start inserting CSS rules into our styles file and applying a box model,
                      we must review the basic concepts about CSS styles that are going to be used in the rest of the book
                      . Applying styles to HTML elements changes the way they are presented on the screen. What
                      explained above, browsers provide default styles that in most cases are not
                       enough to meet the needs of designers. To change this, we can overwrite these
                        styles with ours using different techniques.  <br><br>

                        <strong> Basic concepts :</strong><br> In this book you will find only a brief introduction to CSS styles. Only
                        we mention the techniques and properties that you need to know to understand the topics and codes studied in
                         upcoming chapters. If you think you don't have enough CSS experience and need more information visit
                          our website and follow the links to this chapter.  <br><br>
                     
                       <strong>  Do it yourself :</strong><br> Inside an empty text file, copy each HTML code studied in the following
                       listings and open the file in your browser to check it out. Note that the file must
                       have the .html extension to be opened and processed correctly.  <br><br>
                     


                     <span class="tito">-  online styles :</span><br>

                     One of the simplest techniques for incorporating CSS styles into an HTML document is to assign the styles
                     inside the tags via the style attribute. Listing 2-1 shows a simple HTML document that contains
                      the p element modified by the style attribute with the value font-size: 20px. This style resizes by
                          Default the text inside the p element to a new size of 20 pixels.<br><br>
                  
                          <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_12.png"><br>
                          Listing 2-1.<br><br>
                          CSS styles within HTML tags. Using the technique demonstrated above is a good way to test
                          styles and get a quick view of their effects, but it is not recommended to apply styles to the entire
                           document. The reason is simple: when we use this technique, we must write and repeat each style in each
                           one of the elements we want to modify, increasing the size of the document to unacceptable proportions
                           and making it impossible to maintain and update. Just imagine what would happen if you decided that instead of
                           20 pixels the size of each of the p elements should be 24 pixels. I would have to modify each
                               styling on each p tag in the entire document.<br><br>




                            <span class="tito">-  online styles :</span><br>

                            A better alternative is to insert the styles in the document header and then use references
                            to affect the corresponding HTML elements:<br><br>
                            <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_13.png"><br>

                            Listing 2-2. Styles listed in the document header. <br><br>

                            The style element (shown in Listing 2-2) allows developers to group styles
                            CSS inside the document. In previous versions of HTML it was necessary
                       specify what kind of styles would be inserted. In HTML5 the default styles are CSS, so
                       So we don't need to add any attribute in the opening style tag. The highlighted code
                       in Listing 2-2 has the same function as the line of code in Listing 2-1, but in Listing 2-2
                        we didn't have to write the style inside each p tag because all the p elements were already
                         affected. With this method, we reduce our code and assign the styles we want to elements
                         specific using references. We will see more about references in this chapter.<br><br>




   <span class="tito">-  external files : </span><br>
   Declaring the styles in the document header saves space and makes the code more consistent and
   updatable, but it requires us to make a copy of each style group in every document in our
   website. The solution is to move all the styles to an external file and then use the link element
    to insert this file into each document that needs them. This method allows us to change the
     styles entirely by simply including a different file. It also allows us to modify or adapt
      our documents to each circumstance or device, as we will see at the end of the book. In the chapter
      1, we studied the link tag and how to use it to insert files with CSS styles into our documents. Using the
      line link rel=”stylesheet” href=”mystyles.css” we tell the browser to load the file mystyles.css because it contains
      all the styles needed to present the document on the screen. This practice was widely adopted by designers who
       they are already working with HTML5. The <link> tag referencing the CSS file will be inserted in each of the documents that
       require those styles: <br><br>






       <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_14.png"><br>
                Listing 2-3. Applying CSS styles from an external file. <br><br>

      
       <strong> Do it yourself :</strong><br> From now on we will add CSS styles to the file called mystyles.css. You must create this file in
       the same directory (folder) where the HTML file is located and copy the CSS styles inside it to check how they work<br><br>

  <strong>Basic concepts :</strong><br>CSS files are common text files. Just like HTML files, you can create them using any
  text editor like Windows Notepad, for example. <br><br>



 <span class="tito">- Referencias :</span><br>

 Storing all our styles in an external file and inserting this file inside every document that needs it is
 very convenient, however we will not be able to do it without good mechanisms that help us to establish a specific relationship between
  these styles and the elements of the document that are going to be affected. When we talked about how to include styles in the document,
   we show one of the techniques often used in CSS to reference HTML elements. In Listing 2-2, the style to change
   the font size referenced each p element using the p keyword. In this way the style inserted between the
        style tags referenced each p tag in the document and assigned that particular style to each of them. exist
        several methods to select which HTML elements will be affected by the CSS rules:<br><br>

 -*- reference by element keyword<br> 
-*- reference by id attribute <br>
-*- reference by the class attribute <br><br>

We will see later that CSS3 is quite flexible in this respect and incorporates new and more specific techniques for referencing elements,
but for now we will apply only these three. <br><br>



<span class="tito">- referencing with keyword : </span><br>

By declaring CSS rules using the element keyword we affect every element of the same class in the document.
For example, the following rule will change the styles of all p elements: p { font-size: 20px } Listing 2-4. referencing
     by keyword. This is the technique presented previously in Listing 2-2. Using the keyword p in front of the
     rule we are telling the browser that this rule should be applied to every p element found in the HTML document.
          All text wrapped in p tags will be 20 pixels in size. Of course, the same will work for any
              another HTML element. If we specify the keyword span instead of p, for example, each text between span tags
                   will have a size of 20 pixels:<br><br>

span { font-size: 20px } <br><br>

But what if we only need to reference a specific tag? Should we use the style attribute again inside this
label? The answer is no. As we learned earlier, the Inline Styles method (using the style attribute inside HTML tags)
 it is an obsolete technique and should be avoided. To select a specific HTML element from the rules in our CSS file,
  we can use two different attributes: id and class.<br><br>



  
  <span class="tito">- Referencing with the id attribute :</span><br>

  The id attribute is like a name that identifies the element. This means that the value of this attribute cannot be duplicated.
  This name must be unique throughout the document. To reference a particular element using the id attribute from our
  CSS file the rule must be declared with the # symbol in front of the value we use to identify the element: #text1
   { font-size: 20px } Listing 2-6. Referencing through the value of the id attribute. The rule in Listing 2-6 will be applied to the
   HTML element identified with the attribute id=”text1”. Now our HTML code will look like this:<br><br>
  <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_30.png"><br><br>
  Listing 2-7. Identifying the p element through its id attribute.<br><br>

  The result of this procedure is that every time we make a reference using the identifier text1 in our
  CSS file, the element with that id value
will be modified, but the rest of the p elements, or any other elements in the same document, will not be affected. This is a way
extremely specific way of referencing an element and is often used for more general elements, such as tags
structural. The id attribute and its specificity is actually more appropriate for Javascript references, as we will see in
upcoming chapters. <br><br>



       <span class="tito">- Referencing with the class attribute :</span><br>
       Most of the time, instead of using the id attribute for styling purposes, it's better to use class. This attribute is more flexible
       and can be assigned to each HTML element in the document that shares a similar layout: .text1 { font-size: 20px } Listing 2-8.
       Referencing by the value of the class attribute. To work with the class attribute, we must declare the CSS rule with a dot before
        Of the name. The advantage of this method is that inserting the class attribute with the value text1 will be enough to assign these
        styles to any element we want:<br> <br> 

   <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_31.png"><br> 
       Listing 2-9. Assigning styles to various elements through the class attribute.<br> <br> 
       
       The p elements on the first two lines within the body of the code in Listing 2-9 have the class attribute.
       with the value text1. As we said previously, the same rule can be applied to different elements in the same
        document. Therefore, these first two elements share the same rule and both will be affected by the
        style of Listing 2-8. The last p element preserves the default styles given by the browser.
The reason we must use a dot in front of the rule name is that it is possible to build more complex references.<br> <br> 
For example, you can use the same value for the class attribute on different elements but assign different styles to them.
 each type: p.text1 { font-size: 20px } Listing 2-10. Referencing only p elements through the value of the class attribute.
     In Listing 2-10 we created a rule that references the class called text1 but only for elements of type p. If any other
          element has the same value in its class attribute will not be modified by this particular rule.<br> <br> 




          
          <span class="tito">- Referencing with any attribute :</span><br> 
          Although the reference methods studied above cover a wide spectrum of situations, sometimes they are not enough.
          to find the exact item. The latest version of CSS has added new ways to reference HTML elements. One of
          them is the Attribute Selector. Now we can reference an element not only by the id and class attributes but also through
          from any other attributes: p[name] { font-size: 20px } Listing 2-11. <br> <br> Referencing only p elements that have the name attribute.
               The rule in Listing 2-11 changes only p elements that have an attribute called name. To mimic what we did previously
                    With the id and class attributes, we can also specify the value of the attribute: p[name=”mytext”] { font-size: 20px }
                     Listing 2-12. Referencing p elements that have a name attribute with the value mytext. CSS3 allows to combine “=” with
                          others to make a more specific selection: p[name^=”my”] { font-size: 20px } p[name$=”my”] { font-size: 20px }
                          p[name*=”my”] { font-size: 20px } Listing 2-13. New selectors in CSS3.Enter
        If you know Regular Expressions from other languages ​​like Javascript or PHP, you will be able to recognize the selectors used in the
        Listing 2-13. In CSS3 these selectors produce similar results: <br> <br> 

-*- The rule with the ^= selector will be assigned to every p element that contains a name attribute with a value starting with "my".
(for example, “mytext”, “myhouse”).<br> <br> 
 -*- The rule with the $= selector will be assigned to every p element that contains a name attribute with a value ending in "my"
 (for example " textomi ", " casami "). <br> <br> 
-*- The rule with the *= selector will be assigned to every p element that contains a name attribute with a value that includes the text “my”
(in this case, the text could also be found in the middle, as in “ textomicasa ”).<br> <br> 


In these examples we use the p element, the name attribute, and a random text string like “my”, but the same technique can
      be used with any attribute and value we need. You just have to type the brackets and insert between them
      the attribute name and value you need to reference the correct HTML element.<br> <br> 




      
      <span class="tito">- Referencing with pseudo classes :</span><br> 

      CSS3 also introduces new pseudo classes that make selection even more specific.<br><br>  
<img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm32.png"><br>  
Listing 2-14. Template for testing pseudo classes. <br> <br> 

Let's take a look at the new HTML code in Listing 2-14 for a moment. It contains four p elements which, considering the HTML structure,
they are siblings of each other and children of the same div element. Using pseudo classes we can take advantage of this organization and reference
    a specific element no matter how much we know about its attributes and their value:
p:nth-child(2){ background: #999999; } Listing 2-15. Pseudo class nth-child(). The pseudo class is added using a colon after the
reference and before your name. In the rule in Listing 2-15 we reference only p elements. This rule may include other references.
For example, we could write it as .myclass:nthchild(2) to reference any element that is a child of another element and has the
value of its class attribute equal to myclass. The pseudo class can be applied to any previously studied reference type.
The nth-child() pseudo class allows us to find a specific child. As we explained, the HTML document in Listing 2-14 has
four p elements that are siblings. This means that they all have the same parent which is the div element. what is
pseudo class is actually indicating is something like: "the child at position..." so the number in parentheses will be the
child position number, or index. The rule in Listing 2-15 is referencing every second p element found
  in the document.<br> <br>


<strong>do it yourself :</strong><br>Replace the code in your HTML file with Listing 2-14 and open the file in your browser.
Incorporate the
rules studied in Listing 2-15 inside the mystyles.css file to check their operation. Using this method of
 reference we can, of course, select any children we need by changing the index number. For example, the following
  rule will have impact only on the last p element of our template: p:nth-child(4){ background: #999999; } Listing 2-16.
      Pseudo class nth-child(). As you have probably noticed, it is possible to assign styles to all elements by creating a
      rule for each of them: *{ margin: 0px; }
p:nth-child(1){ background: #999999; } p:nth-child(2){ background: #CCCCCC; } p:nth-child(3){ background: #999999; } p:nth-child(4)
{ background: #CCCCCC; } Listing 2-17. <br> <br>Creating a list with the nth-child() pseudo class. The first rule in Listing 2-17 uses the
 universal selector * to assign the same style to each element of the document. This new selector represents each of the
 elements in the body of the document and is useful when we need to establish certain ground rules. In this case, we set the margin
 of all elements to 0 pixels to avoid whitespace or empty lines like those created by the p element by default.
     In the rest of the code in Listing 2-17 we use the nth-child() pseudo class to generate a menu or list of options that are
     clearly differentiated on the screen by the background color. <br> <br>


     <strong>Do it yourself : </strong> <br>Copy the last code inside the CSS file and open the HTML document in your browser to check the effect.
     To add more options to the menu, we can embed new p elements in the HTML code and new rules with the pseudo class
         nth-child() using the appropriate index number.<br> <br> However, this approach generates a lot of code and is impossible to apply
          on websites with dynamic content. An alternative to get the same result is to take advantage of the odd and even keywords.
           available for this pseudo class: *{ margin: 0px; } p:nth-child(odd){ background: #999999; } p:nth-child(even){ background:
            #CCCCCC; } Listing 2-18. Leveraging the odd and even keywords
    Now we only need two rules to create the entire list. Even if we add other options later, the styles will be
    automatically assigned to each of them according to their position. The odd keyword for the nth-child() pseudo class affects
    p elements that are children of another element and have an odd index. <br> <br>The even keyword, on the other hand, affects those that
    have an even index. There are other important pseudo-classes related to the latter, such as first child, last-child and only-child,
     some of them recently incorporated. The pseudo class first-child references only the first child, last-child references only
     the last child, and only-child affects an element as long as it is the only available child. These pseudo classes in particular do not
      they require keywords or parameters, and are implemented as in the following example: *{ margin: 0px; } p:last-child{ background:
         #999999; } Listing 2-19. Using last-child to modify only the last p element of the list. Another important pseudo class
              not() call is used to perform a negation: :not(p){ margin: 0px; } Listing 2-20. Applying styles to each element,
               except p. The rule in Listing 2-20 will assign a margin of 0 pixels to every element in the document except elements
                   p. Unlike the previously used universal selector, the not() pseudo class allows us to declare an exception.
                       The styles in the rule created with this pseudo class will be assigned to all elements except those included in the
                       reference in parentheses.<br> <br> Instead of the keyword of an element we can use any other reference that
                       we wish In the next listing, for example, all elements will be affected except those with the value
                       mytext2 in the class attribute: :not(.mytext2){ margin: 0px; } Listing 2-21. Exception using the class attribute.

When we apply the last rule to the HTML code in Listing 2-14, the browser assigns the default styles to the p element.
     identified with the class attribute and the value mytext2 and provides a margin of 0 pixels to the rest. <br> <br>




     <span class="tito">- new selectors :</span><br>

     There are a few more selectors that were added or are now considered part of CSS3 and may be useful for our layouts.
     These selectors use the >, +, and ~ symbols to specify the relationship between elements. div > p.mytext2{ color: #990000; } listing
      2-22. Chooser >. The selector > is indicating that the element to be affected by the rule is the element on the right when it has
       the one on the left as his father. The rule in Listing 2-22 modifies p elements that are children of a div element.<br><br> In this
           In this case, we were very specific and only referenced the p element with the value mytext2 in its class attribute. The next
               example builds a selector using the + symbol. This selector references the element on the right when it is
               immediately preceded by the one on the left. Both elements must share the same parent: p.mytext2 + p{ color: #990000; }
                Listing 2-23. Picker +. The rule in Listing 2-23 affects the p element that is located after another p element.
                    identified with the value mytext2 in its class attribute.<br><br> If you open the HTML file with the Listing code in your browser
                    2-14, the text in the third p element will appear on the screen in red because this particular p element
                         is positioned immediately after the p element identified with the value mytext2 in its class attribute. The
                             The last selector we will study is the one built with the ~ symbol. This selector is similar to the previous one but the
                             affected element need not immediately precede the element to the left. Also, more than one item
                              may be affected:<br><br>
                              p.mytext2 ~ p{ color: #990000; } Listing 2-24. Picker ~. The rule in Listing 2-24 affects the third and fourth elements p of our
                              example template. The style will be applied to all p elements that are siblings and are found after the p element.
                                  identified with the value mytext2 in its class attribute. It does not matter if other elements are interspersed, the elements
                                  p in the third and fourth position will still be affected. You can check the latter by inserting a span element mytext /span
                                     after the p element that has the value mytext2 in its class attribute. Despite this change only the p elements will be
                                         modified by this rule. <br><br>



                <span class="tito">- Applying CSS to our template :</span><br>

                As we learned earlier in this chapter, every structural element is considered a box and the
                complete structure is presented as a group of boxes. The grouped boxes constitute what is called a Box Model.
                 Continuing with the basics of CSS, we are going to study what is called the Traditional Box Model. This model has
                 been implemented since the first version of CSS and is currently supported by every browser on the market, which has
                 become a standard for web design. Any model, even those still in the experimental phase, can be applied to
                 the same HTML structure, but this structure must be prepared to be affected by these styles properly.
                 Our HTML documents must be adapted to the selected box model. IMPORTANT: The Traditional Box Model
                  presented later is not an addition to HTML5, but is introduced in this book because it is the only one available in
                  right now and possibly the one that will continue to be used in websites developed in HTML5 for the next
                   years. If you already know how to implement it, feel free to skip this part of the chapter.<br><br>

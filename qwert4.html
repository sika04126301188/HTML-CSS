            <h1 class="titelo">_ new and old items : </h1> 
            <p class="parami">

                HTML5 was developed with the intention of simplifying, specifying, and organizing code. To achieve this purpose, new
                 tags and attributes were added and HTML was fully integrated with CSS and Javascript. These additions and
                  improvements from previous versions are related not only to new elements but also to how we use the already existing ones.
                  existing. <br><br>

              


        
                 <span class="tito">- mark  : </span> <br>
                 The mark tag was added to highlight part of a text that was not originally considered.
                 important but is now relevant according to the user's actions. The example that best fits
                 in this case it is a search result. The mark element will highlight the part of the text that matches
                     with the search text: spanMy sea kcar /sea is red /span Listing 1-19. Using the mark element
                          to highlight the word “car”. If a user performs a search for the word “car”, for example,
  the results could be displayed with the code from Listing 1-19. The example sentence represents the
  search results and the mark tags in the middle enclose what the searched text was
      (the word “car”). In some browsers, this word will be highlighted with a yellow background
      by default, but we can always override these styles with our own using CSS, like
       We will see in future chapters. In the past, we usually got similar results using
       the element b. The addition of mark has the objective of changing the meaning and giving a
           new purpose for these and related items: <br><br>
           -*-em is for emphasis (replacing the i tag we used earlier).<br><br>
                     -*-strong is to indicate importance.<br><br>
                     -*-mark is for highlighting text that is relevant to the circumstances. <br><br>
                     -*-b should be used only when there is no other element more appropriate for the situation. <br><br>
                    
                   
                     <span class="tito">- small :</span><br>

                     The new HTML specificity is also evident in elements like small. Previously this element was used with the intention
                     to present any text in fine print. The keyword referenced the size of the text, regardless of its
                      meaning. In HTML5, the new purpose of small is to present so-called fine print, such as legal impressions, disclaimers, <br><br>
           
   
        
         <span class="tito">- cite :</span><br>

         Another element that has changed its nature to become more specific is quote. Now the cite tags enclose the
         title of a work, such as a book, a movie, a song. <br><br>
    
                    
        <span class="tito">- address :</span><br>

        The address element is an old element converted into a structural element. We don't need to use it before
             build our template, however it could fit perfectly in some situations where we need to present
             contact information related to the content of the article element or the full body. This item should be
              included within
              footer, as in the following example:<br>

                <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_11.png"><br><br>

          
          
                <span class="tito">- time :</span><br>

                On each article in our latest template (Listing 1-18), we include the date indicating when the post was
                published. For this we use a simple p element inside the header of the message, but there is a
                element in HTML5 specific for this purpose. <br><br>
           
                The time element allows us to declare understandable text
                for humans and browsers that represents date and time: article header h1 Post title dos/h1
          /header This is the text of the message
         /article Listing 1-23. Date and time using the time element. In Listing 1-23, the p element used
              in previous examples it was replaced by the new time element to display the date on which
           the message was posted. <br><br>
   
           The datetime attribute has the value that represents the understandable date
           for the browser (timestamp). The format of this value should follow a pattern similar to that of the
           following example: 2040-10-12T12:10:45. We also include the pubdate attribute, which is just
            added to indicate that the value of the datetime attribute represents the publication date. <br><br>
                   
                            
     <span class="tito">- Quick reference : </span><br>

     In the HTML5 specification, HTML is in charge of document structure and provides a whole set of new elements for it.
      purpose. The specification also includes some elements with the sole task of providing styles. This is a list of those
      We consider most relevant:
     IMPORTANT: For a complete reference of the HTML elements included in the specification, visit our website and follow the
     links to this chapter.<br><br>
     
     <span class="tito">- header :</span><br>

         <span class="tito">- nav :</span> <br>
         This element indicates a section of links for navigation purposes, such as menus or indexes. not all links
             inside a web page have to be inside a nav element, only those that are part of blocks of

                  <span class="tito">- section :</span><br>

                  book pages, newsgroups, articles,  <br><br>
   
    <span class="tito">- aside :</span>
    This element represents content that is related to the main content but is not part of it. Examples can be
    quotes, sidebar information, advertising. <br><br>

         <span class="tito">- footer :</span><br>
         This element represents additional information about its parent element. For example, a footer element inserted at
         end of body will provide additional information about the body of the document, like the normal footer of a web page.
          It can be used not only for the body but also for different sections within the body, giving information
          information on these specific sections. <br><br>
           
        
                  <span class="tito">- article :</span> <br>
                  This element represents an independent piece of relevant information (for example, each article in a newspaper
                  or each blog entry). The article element can be nested and used to display a list within another list.
                      of related items, such as user comments on blog posts, for example.<br><br>
                    
                        <span class="tito">- hgroup :</span><br> 
                        This element is used to group H elements when the header has multiple levels.
                        (for example, a header with title and subtitle). <br><br>

                     <span class="tito">- figure :</span><br>
                     This element represents an independent piece of content (for example, images, diagrams or videos)

                         fluid from the rest of the content. <br><br>
                         
                                <span class="tito">- figcaption :</span><br>

                                figure element, such as an image description. <br><br>
                                    
                     <span class="tito">- mark :</span><br>

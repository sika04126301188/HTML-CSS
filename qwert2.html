                (the code between the body tags) will generate the visible part of the document. This is the code that will produce our web page.
                HTML has always offered different ways to build and organize information within the body of a document. One of the first
                elements provided for this purpose was table. Tables allowed designers to accommodate data, text, images, and
                    tools within rows and columns of cells, even if they were not designed for this purpose. In the first
                    days of the web, tables were a revolution, a huge step forward from viewing documents
                    and the experience offered to users. Later, gradually, other elements replaced its function, allowing to achieve
                    the same with less code, thus facilitating the creation, allowing portability and helping the maintenance of the
                    websites. The div element started to dominate the scene. With the emergence of more interactive websites and the integration of
                            HTML, CSS and Javascript, the use of div became a common practice. But this element, like table, does not provide
                    Too much information about the body part it's depicting. From images to menus, texts, links,
                    codes, forms, anything can go between the opening and closing tags of a div element.<br><br> 
                    In others
                    words, the div keyword only specifies a div in the body, like a table cell, but doesn't offer
                        any clue as to what kind of partition it is, what its purpose is, or what it contains. For users these
                        keys or clues are not important, but for browsers the correct interpretation of what is inside
                    of the document being processed can be crucial in many cases. <br><br>
                 
                    After the revolution of mobile devices and
                    the emergence of different ways that people access the web, the identification of each part of the document is a
                    task that has become more relevant than ever. Considering all the above, HTML4 incorporates new elements that help
                    identify each section of the document and organize the body of the document. In HTML5 the most important sections are
                    differentiated and the main structure no longer depends on the div or table elements. <br><br>
                 
                    How do we use these new
                    elements depends on us, but the keywords given to each of them help us to understand
                    its functions. Normally a page or web application is divided into several visual areas to improve
                    the user experience and facilitate interactivity. keywords that represent

each new HTML5 element is closely related to these areas, as we will see soon. Organization
Figure 1-1 represents a common layout found on most websites these days. In spite of the fact
Since each designer creates their own designs, in general we will be able to identify the following sections on each site
       website studied <br><br>


        
                 <span class="tito">- Visual representation of a classic web design : </span> <br>
                 At the top, described as Header, is the space where the logo, title,
                 subheadings and a short description of the website or page. Immediately below, we can see the Navigation Bar
                 in which almost all developers offer a menu or list of links for the purpose of easy navigation
                 through the site. Users are guided from this bar to the different pages or documents, usually
                 belonging to the same website. The most relevant content of a web page is, in almost every design, located
                  in its center. This section features valuable information and links. Most of the time it is divided into several rows and
                   columns


                   only two columns: Main Information and Sidebar, but this section is extremely flexible and
                   normally designers adapt it according to their needs by inserting more columns, dividing each column
                   between smaller blocks or generating different distributions and combinations. <br><br>The content presented in this
                   part of the design is usually a high priority. In the example layout, Main Information might contain a
                    list of items, product descriptions, blog posts or any other important information, and the Toolbar
                     Lateral could display a list of links pointing to each of those items. In a blog, for example, the latter
                      column will offer a list of links pointing to each blog entry, information about the author, etc… In the
                       base of a classic web design we always find one more bar that here we call Institutional. we named her
                        in this way because this is the area where information about the website, the author or
                        the company, as well as some links regarding rules, terms and conditions and any additional information that
                        the developer considers it important to share. The Institutional bar is a complement to the Header and is part
                        of what is considered these days the essential structure of a web page.<br> <br>
                 
                 


                            <span class="tito"> - is a representation of a normal blog : </span><br>



           
                            In this example, each part of the design considered above can be clearly identified. 1. Header 2.
                            Navigation Bar 3. Main Information Section 4. Sidebar 5. The footer or the Institutional bar It is simple
                            Representation of a blog can help us understand that each defined section on a website has a purpose. sometimes this
                             purpose is not clear but in essence it is always there, helping us to recognize any of the sections described
                              previously in all design. HTML5 considers this basic structure and provides new elements to differentiate and declare each
                              one of its parts. <br><br>

          
          
          <span class="tito"> - shows the typical design presented above :</span> <br>

          but this time with the corresponding HTML5 elements for each section (including opening and closing tags). header
          One of the new elements incorporated in HTML5 is header. The header element should not be confused with head used
              before to build the document header. Like head, the intent of header is to provide information
   introductory (titles, subtitles, logos), but differs from hea> in its scope. while the element
        head is intended to provide information about the entire document, header is used only for the body
             or specific sections within the body:<br><br>

                 !DOCTYPE html html lang="es" <br>
                     head<br>
                          meta charset="iso-8859-1"<br>
                     meta name="description" content="Ejemplo de HTML5"<br>
        meta name="keywords" content="HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript" <br>
        title Este texto es el título del documento /title<br>
            link rel="stylesheet" href="misestilos.css"<br>
         /head<br>
          body<br>
               header h1 Este es el título principal del sitio web /h1<br>
        /header><br>
        /body<br>
         /html<br><br>

         <span class="tito"> - Using the header element :</span><br>

         we define the title of the page
               web using the header element. Remember that this header is not the same as the one used previously for
                   define the title of the document. The insertion of the header element represents the beginning of the body and therefore
                        both of the visible part of the document. From now on it will be possible to see the results of our code in
                        the browser window. Do it yourself: If you followed the instructions from the beginning of this chapter
                        You should already have a text file created with all the codes studied so far and that's it
                         to be tested. If not, all you need to do is copy the code in Listing 1-10 into
                          an empty text file using any text editor (such as Windows Notepad, for
           example) and save the file with the name of your choice and the html extension. To see the code at work, open the file
            in an HTML5 compatible browser (you can do this by double-clicking on the file in your file browser). Concepts
            basics: Among the header tags in Listing 1-10 is an element you probably don't know about. The h1 element is an old
                 HTML element used to define titles. The number indicates the importance of the title. The h1 element is the most important
                     and h6 the least important, therefore h1 will be used to display the main title and the others for
                          subtitles or internal subtitles. Later we will see how these elements work in HTML5. <br><br>
                      
                          <span class="tito"> -    nav  : </span><br>
                          Continuing with our example, the next section is the Navigation Bar.
                          This bar is generated in HTML5 with the element <br><br>
                           nav:<br><br>
                            <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_3.png"><br><br>


                            As you can see in Listing 1-11, the nav element
                            is inside the body tags but is placed after the <body> tag.
                                 head closure<br><br>
                                   
                                
                               
                                 (/header), not inside header tags. This is because nav is not part of the header but a
                                 new section. Earlier we said that the structure and the order we choose to place the elements
                                 HTML5 depend on us. This means that HTML5 is versatile and only gives us the parameters and
                basic elements to work with, but how to use them will be entirely up to us. An example
                 One of this versatility is that the nav element could be inserted inside the header element or in any
                     another part of the body. <br><br>
                     However, it should always be considered that these labels were created to
                      provide information to browsers and help each new program and device on the market to
                      identify the most relevant parts of the document. To keep our code portable and understandable,
                       We recommend as a good practice to follow the standards and keep everything as clear as possible
                        possible.<br><br>
                        The nav element was created to provide navigation aids, such as in main menus.
                             or large link blocks, and it should be used that way. Basics: In the
                              example of Listing 1-11 we generate the menu options for our web page. between the labels
                               nav there are two elements that are used to create a list. The purpose of the ul element is
                       define the list. Nested between the ul tags we find several li tags with
                           different texts representing the menu options. The li tags, like probably
                               you've already noticed, they are used to define each item in the list.<br><br>
                                El propósito de este 
                                book is not to teach you basics about HTML, if you need more information about elements
                                regular users of this language visit our website and follow the links for this chapter.<br><br>




                                <span class="tito"> - section :</span><br>

  Following our standard design, we find the columns that in Figure 1-1 we call Main Information and Sidebar.
  As explained above, the Main Information column contains the most relevant information in the document and can be found
  in different ways (for example, divided into several blocks or columns). Because the purpose of these columns is more general, the
  element in HTML5 that specifies these sections is called simply <br><br>
     section:<br><br>
        <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_4.png"><br><br>

        Using the element <br><br>
        section. Like the Navigation Bar, the Main Information column
        it is a separate section. For this reason, the section for Main Information goes below the closing /nav tag.
 Do It Yourself: Compare the last code in Listing 1-12 with the design in Figure 1-3 to understand how labels
  are located in the code and what section each of them generates in the visual representation of the web page. IMPORTANT:
  The tags that represent each section of the document are located in the code in the form of a list, one above the other,
   but on the website some of these sections will be placed side by side (the Main Info and Sidebar columns
    are a clear example). In HTML5, the responsibility for rendering elements on the screen was delegated to CSS.
     The layout will be achieved by assigning CSS styles to each HTML element. We will study CSS in the next chapter. <br><br>



         <span class="tito"> - aside :</span> <br>
         In a typical web design (Figure 1-1) the column labeled Sidebar is located next to the Main Information column.
            This is a column or section that typically contains data that is related to the main information but is not relevant.
            or just as important. In a blog layout, for example, the Sidebar will contain a list of links. In the example of
             In Figure 1-2, the links point to each of the blog posts and provide additional information about the author (number 4).
              The information within this
            bar is related to the main information but is not relevant by itself. Following the same example we can say that
             the blog posts are relevant but the links and small reviews on those posts are just an aid to the
             navigation but not what the reader is really interested in. In HTML5 we can differentiate this secondary class of information
              using the element <br>
              
                  aside<br>
                  <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_5.png"><br><br>
              
         
                  The aside element could be located on the right or left side of our example page, the tag does not have a
                  position
                  predefined. The aside element only describes the information it contains, not its place within the structure. this item
                      it can be located anywhere in the design and be used as long as its content is not considered as the
                      main content of the document. For example, we can use aside inside the section element or even inserted
                          between the relevant information, as in the case of a citation. <br><br>
            
                         <span class="tito"> - footer : </span><br>

                         To finish the construction of the template or elemental structure of our HTML5 document, we only need one more element.
                         We already have the header of the body, sections with help for navigation, important information and even a sidebar
                         with additional data, so the only thing left for us to do is close our design to give the body of the
                         document. HTML5 provides a specific element for this purpose called <br>
                         footer<br><br>
      <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_6.png"><br><br>
 
 
 
      In the typical design of a web page (Figure 1-1) the section called Institutional will be defined by labels
      footer. This is because the bar represents the end (or foot)
     of the document and this part of the web page is normally used to share general information about the author or
      the organization behind the project. Generally, the footer element will represent the end of the body of our document and
           will have the purpose described above. However, footer can be used multiple times within the body to
                also render the end of different sections (in the same way as the header tag). We will study the latter
                     feature later

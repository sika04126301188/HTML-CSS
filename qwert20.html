                To work with long codes and custom functions we must group the codes in the same place between labels
                script. The script element acts exactly the same as the style element used to embed CSS styles. help us organize
                the code in one place, affecting HTML elements through references. Just like with the style element,
                in HTML5 we should not use any attribute to specify language. It is no longer necessary to include the type attribute in the tag
                script. HTML5 assigns Javascript by default.<br> <br> 
  <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_53.png"> <br> 
  Listing 4-2. Embedded JavaScript. <br> <br> 

  The script element and its content can be positioned anywhere in the document, within or between other elements.
  For clarity, we recommend always placing your Javascript codes in the head of the document (as in the example in Listing 4-2).
   and then referencing the elements to be affected using the appropriate Javascript methods for that purpose. There are currently three
   available methods to reference HTML elements from Javascript: <br> <br>
 
 • getElementsByTagName (used in Listing 4-2) references an element by name or keyword.<br>
 
  • getElementById references an element by the value of its id attribute.<br>
 
  • getElementsByClassName is a new addition that allows us to reference an element by the value of its class attribute.<br> <br>  



  Even if we follow the best practice (position the code inside the document header), one situation must be considered:
  the document code is read sequentially by the browser and we cannot reference an element that has not yet been created. In it
   Listing 4-2, the code is positioned in the head of the document and is read by the browser prior to the creation of the p element
       that we are referencing. <br><br>
       If we had tried to affect the p element directly with a reference, we would have received a message
        error announcing that the element does not exist. To avoid this problem, the code was converted to a function called
         showalert(), and the reference to the p element along with the event handler were placed in a second function
  call click(). Functions are called from the last line of code using another event handler
  (in this case associated with the window) called onload.<br><br>
  This handler will execute the click() function when the
  document is fully loaded and all elements created. It is time to analyze how the document of the
  Listing 4-2 is executed. First the Javascript functions are loaded (declared) but not executed. Later
    HTML elements, including p elements, are created. And finally, when the entire document is
        loaded in the browser window, the load event is fired and the click() function is called. In this function, the
         getElementsByTagName method references all p elements.<br><br>
             This method returns an array containing a
             list of elements of the specified class found in the document. However, using the index[0] at the end of the method
              we indicate that we only want the first element of the list to be returned. Once this element is identified, the
              code register handler

              onclick events for the same. The showalert() function will be executed when the click event is fired on this showing element.
              the message “clicked!”. It may seem like a lot of code and work to reproduce the same effect achieved by a single line in the example.
              from Listing 4-1. However, considering the potential of HTML5 and the complexity achieved by Javascript, the concentration of the code in
              a single place and the proper organization represents a great advantage for our future implementations and for making our sites
               web and applications easy to develop and maintain. <br><br>



 <span class="tito">- Basic concepts    : </span>  <br>

 A function is a group of code that is executed only when the function is invoked (activated or called) by its name. Normally, one
 function is called using its name and some values ​​enclosed in parentheses (for example, click(1,2)). An exception to this syntax
  is used in Listing 4-2. In this code we don't use parentheses because we are passing only the function reference to the event, not the
  result of its execution. To learn more about Javascript features, visit our website and follow the links to e
  this chapter. <br><br>

<span class="tito">-   external files    : </span>  <br>

Javascript codes grow exponentially when we add new features and apply some of the previously mentioned APIs.
Embedded codes increase the size of our documents and make them repetitive (each document must include the same
codes). To reduce download times, increase our productivity and be able to distribute and reuse our codes in each
document without compromising efficiency, we recommend saving all Javascript code in one or more external files and calling them using
the src attribute: <br><br>
<img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_54.png"> <br> 
Listing 4-3. Loading the code from external files.<br><br>


The script element in Listing 4-3 loads the Javascript codes from an external file called mycode.js. From now on, we can
insert our codes into this file and then include the same in any document on our website that needs it. From the
user perspective, this practice reduces download times and access to our website, while for us it simplifies the
organization and easy maintenance. <br><br>

 <strong>Do it yourself :</strong> <br> Copy the code from Listing 4-3 into the previously created HTML file. Create a new file
 empty text called mycode.js and copy the Javascript code from Listing 4-2 into it. Note that only the code between the
 script tags should be copied, not including the tags themselves.<br><br>

                For many years designers have suffered trying to achieve the effect of rounded corners in the boxes of their web pages. The process
                it was almost always frustrating and exhausting. Everyone has suffered from it. If you watch any video presentation of the new
                built-in features in HTML5, whenever someone talks about CSS3 properties that make it possible to easily generate
                rounded corners, the audience goes crazy. Rounded corners were the kind of things that made us think: “it should be
                easy to do”. However it never was. This is the reason why, among all the new possibilities and incredible properties
                 built into CSS3, the one we'll explore first is border-radius:<br> <br> 

  <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_36.png"><br> 
  Listing 3-3. Generating rounded corners.<br> <br>
  The border-radius property is currently experimental so we must use the prefixes –moz- and -webkit- so that
  work in browsers based on Gecko and WebKit engines, such as Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome (the prefixes were studied
  and applied in Chapter 2). If all the corners have the same curvature we can use a single value. However, as
   happens with the margin and padding properties, we can also declare a different value for each one:<br><br>
            <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_37.png"><br> 
            Listing 3-4. Different values ​​for each corner.<br><br>
            As you can see in Listing 3-4, the four values ​​assigned to the border-radius property represent different locations.
             Moving around the box clockwise, the values ​​will be applied in the following order: top left corner,
             upper right corner, lower right corner and lower left corner. Values ​​are always given in the direction of the
              clockwise, starting at the top left corner. As with margin or padding, border-radius can also work
              only with two values. The first value will be assigned to the first and third corners (upper left, lower right), and the second
               value to the second and fourth corners (top right, bottom left). We can also shape the corners by declaring a
               second group of values ​​separated by a slash. The values ​​to the left of the bar will represent the horizontal radius while
               that the values ​​to the right represent the vertical radius. Combining these values ​​generates an ellipsis: <br> <br>

    Listing 3-5. Elliptical corners.<br> <br> 

                 
                
      

      







        <span class="tito">-  Do it yourself : </span><br>  Copy into the CSS file called newcss3.css the styles you want
        try and open the HTML file generated with Listing 3-1 in your browser to check the results. Box-shadow Now that
        finally we have the possibility of generating nice corners for our boxes we can take a risk with something else. Other
         very good effect, which had been
extremely difficult to achieve until now, is shadows. For years designers have combined images, elements and some
CSS properties to generate shadows. Thanks to CSS3 and the new box-shadow property we can apply shadows to our boxes with just
 a simple line of code:<br> <br> 
  <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_39.png"><br>  
  Listing 3-6. Applying shadow to our box. <br><br> 
             

  The box-shadow property needs at least three values. The first, which you can see in the rule in Listing 3-6,
  it is the color. This value was constructed here using the rgb() function and decimal numbers, but we can write it
   in hexadecimal numbers as well, as we did previously for other parameters in this book. the next two
    values, expressed in pixels, set the offset of the shadow. <br> <br>
    This offset can be positive or negative.
     negative. The values ​​indicate, respectively, the horizontal and vertical distance from the shadow to the element.
     Negative values ​​will position the shadow to the left and above the element, while positive values
     will create the shadow to the right and below the element. Values ​​of 0 or null will position the shadow exactly
      behind the element, allowing the possibility of creating a blurred effect all around it.<br> <br> 
 


 
 <span class="tito">-  Do it yourself  : </span><br>   To test the different parameters and possibilities that we have
 To assign a shadow to a box, copy the code from Listing 3-6 into the CSS file and open the HTML file with the template
  from Listing 3-1 in your
browser. You can experiment by changing the values ​​of the box-shadow property and you can use the same code to experiment as well
 with the new parameters discussed below. The shadow we got so far is solid, no gradients or transparencies
  (not really like a shadow usually appears). There are some more parameters and changes that we can implement to improve the
  shadow appearance. A fourth value that can be added to the property already studied is the blur distance. <br> <br>
  with this effect
   now the shadow will look real. You can try to use this new parameter by declaring a value of 10 pixels to the rule in Listing 3-6,
    as in the following example: box-shadow: rgb(150,150,150) 5px 5px 10px; Listing 3-7. Adding the blur value to box-shadow.
     Adding yet another value in pixels to the end of the property will spread the shadow. This effect slightly changes the nature of the
      shadow expanding the area it covers. Although we do not recommend using this effect, it may be applicable to some designs.<br> <br> 
 
 
 <span class="tito">- Do it yourself : </span><br>  Try adding a value of 20 pixels to the end of the style in Listing 3-7 and combine this
 code with the code in Listing 3-6 to test it. IMPORTANT: Always remember that at this time the properties studied are
 experimental. To use them, you must declare each one by adding the corresponding prefixes, such as –moz- or -webkit-, according to the
 browser you use (in this example, Firefox or Google Chrome). <br> <br>
 The last possible value for box-shadow is not a number but rather
 a keyword: inset. This keyword converts the outer shadow to an inner shadow, which provides a shadow effect.
  depth to the affected element. box-shadow: rgb(150,150,150) 5px 5px 10px inset; Listing 3-8. inner shadow. The style in
   Listing 3-8 will show an inner shadow set back from the edge of the box by about 5 pixels and with a 10 pixel blur effect.<br> <br> 
 
 
 
 <span class="tito">-  Do it yourself : </span><br>  The styles in Listings 3-7 and 3-8 are examples only. To check the
 effects in your browser, you must apply these changes to the entire set of rules presented in Listing 3-6.

 IMPORTANT: Drop shadows do not expand the element or increase its size, so you will have to carefully control that
  the space available is enough for the shadow to be exposed and correctly drawn on the screen. <br> <br>

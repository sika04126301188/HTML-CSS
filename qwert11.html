                The web changed forever when a few years ago new applications built on top of Ajax implementations improved the
                design and user experience. Version 2.0, assigned to the web to describe a new level of development, represented a change
                 not only in the way information was transmitted but also in how websites and new applications were designed and
                 built.<br><br> The codes implemented in this new generation of websites soon became standard. innovation became
                  so important to the success of any Internet project that programmers developed entire libraries to overcome
                  limitations and meet the new requirements of designers. Lack of support by browsers
                  was evident, but the organization responsible for web standards did not take the trends very seriously and tried to follow
                  your own way. <br><br>Fortunately, some brilliant minds kept developing new standards in parallel and soon
                  HTML5 was born. After the return of calm (and some agreements in between), the integration between HTML, CSS and Javascript
                  under the tutelage of HTML5 he was like the brave and victorious knight leading the troops towards the enemy palace. Although
                  recent turmoil, this battle started a long time ago, with the first specification of the third version of CSS. <br><br>
                  When finally, around the year 2005, this technology was officially considered standard, CSS was ready to provide
                   the functions required by developers (those that programmers had created years ago using Javascript codes
                    complicated to implement and not always compatible). In this chapter we are going to study the contributions made by CSS3 to
                    HTML5 and all the properties that simplify the lives of designers and programmers.<br><br>
                 
                
        <span class="tito">-css3 goes crazy : </span> <br>

        CSS was always about styling, but not anymore. In an attempt to reduce the use of Javascript code and to standardize
        popular features, CSS3 not only covers web layout and styles but also shape and movement. The CSS3 specification
         is presented in modules that allow the technology to provide a standard specification for each
       aspect involved in the visual presentation of the document. From rounded corners and shadows to transformations
       and repositioning of the elements already presented on the screen, each possible effect previously applied using
       Javascript was covered. <br><br>This level of change makes CSS3 virtually unheard of technology compared to previous versions.
       previous. When the HTML5 specification was written with CSS in charge of design, half the battle against
        the rest of the proposed specifications had been won. <br><br>
       
               

               
 

              


        
                 <span class="tito">-  Template   : </span> <br>
              


                

                 The new CSS3 properties are extremely powerful and should be studied one by one, but for ease of use
                 learning we are going to apply all of them on the same template. For this reason we will start by creating an HTML document
                 simple with some basic styles:<br><br>
                 <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_34.png"><br>
                 Listing 3-1. A simple template for testing new properties. <br><br>
                 
                 Our document only has one section with a short text inside it. The header element used in the template
                 could be replaced by div, nav, section or any other structural element according to the location
                      in design and function. After applying the styles, the box generated with the example code of the
                      Listing 3-1 will look like a header, so we decided to use header in this case. Because
                          the font element is deprecated in HTML5, the elements used to display text are
                               usually span for short lines and p for paragraphs, among others. For this reason the
                                   text in our template was inserted using span tags. <br><br> 
               
 
 

 
 <strong>Do it yourself :</strong> <br> Use the code provided in Listing 3-1 as the template for this chapter. Will need
 also create a new CSS file called newcss3.css to store the styles studied from now on.
The following are the basic styles required by our HTML document:<br><br>
 <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_35.png"><br>
 Listing 3-2. Basic CSS rules to start with.<br><br>
          
 There is nothing new in the rules in Listing 3-2, just the styles needed to shape the template and create a box.

 CSS Web 2.0 Styles. One of the things you'll notice about this box when it's displayed on screen is that its corners
 they are straight This is not something we like, is it? It may or may not be a psychological factor, the truth is that almost no one
  in this business you like straight corners. Therefore, the first thing we will do is change this aspect. <br><br>

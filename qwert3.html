                The body of our document is ready. The basic structure of our website was finalized, but we still have to work on the
                content. The HTML5 elements studied so far help us identify each section of the layout and assign a purpose.
                 intrinsic to each of them, but what is really important for our website is found within these sections.
 <br><br>
 Most of the elements already studied were created to build a structure for the HTML document that can be identified and
 recognized by browsers and new devices. We learned about the body tag used to declare the body or part
     visible part of the document, the header tag with which we group important information for the body, the nav tag that
          provides help for website navigation, the necessary section tag to contain the most relevant information,
              and also aside and footer to offer additional information on each section and the document itself.<br><br>
                
              But none of
              these elements declare something about the content. They all have a specific structural purpose. Deeper
              we get inside the document the closer we are to the definition of the content. This information
              It will be composed of different visual elements such as titles, texts, images, videos and interactive applications.
              , among others. We need to be able to differentiate these elements and establish a relationship between them within the
               structure. <br><br>


        
                 <span class="tito">- articles : </span> <br>
                 The design considered above (Figure 1-1) is the most common and represents an essential structure for these websites.
                 days, but it is also an example of how key content is displayed on screen. Just as blogs are divided into
                  entries, websites usually present relevant information divided into parts that share similar characteristics. The
                   article element allows us to identify each of these parts: <br><br>
        <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_7.png"><br>
        Using the article element<br><br>

        As you can see from the code in Listing 1-15, the article tags are located inside
        of the section element. The article tags in our example belong to this section,
are its children, in the same way that every element inside the body tags is a child
   of the body. And like each child element of the body, the article tags
       they are placed one on top of the other, as shown in Figure 1-4. Basic concepts: As we said before,
        The structure of an HTML document can be described as a tree, with the html element as its root.<br><br>


        Another way to describe the relationship between elements is to name them as parents, children, and siblings, so
        according to the position they occupy within that same structure. For example, in a typical document
        HTML the body element is
child of the html element and sibling of the head element. Both body and head have the html element as their parent.
Figure 1-4. Visual representation of the article tags that were included to contain relevant information
of the website.<br><br>
                
The article element is not limited by its name (it is not limited, for example, to articles from
news). This element was created with the intention of containing independent units of content, for
 which may include forum posts, digital magazine articles, blog posts, comments
 of users, etc… What it does is group pieces of information that are related to each other
 regardless of its nature.<br><br> 
                      
 As an independent part of the document, the content of each
 article element will have its own structure. To define this structure, we can take advantage of the
     versatility of the header and footer elements studied above. These items are
          portable and can be used not only to define the boundaries of the body but also in
          any section of our document: <br><br>
                               <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_8.png"><br>


                               Listing 1-16. Building the structure of article.<br><br>
                                 the two messages
                                        inserted into the code in Listing 1-16 were built with the article element and have a
                                             specific structure. At the top of this structure we include the labels
                                             header containing the title defined with the element
              h1, below is the content of the message itself and at the end, after the text, are the footer tags
                   specifying the number of comments received.<br> <br>
              
                    
                 
                 


                            <span class="tito"> - hgroup : </span><br>



           
   Within each header element, at the top of the body or at the beginning of each article, we incorporate h1 elements
   to declare a title. Basically, the h1 tags are all we need to create a header line for each
       part of the document, but it is normal that we also need to add subtitles or more information that specifies what
        deals with the web page or a particular section. In fact, the header element was created to contain other elements as well.
            such as tables of contents, search forms or short texts and logos. To build this type of headers, we can
            take advantage of the rest of the H tags, such as h>, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6, but always considering that for
                internal processing purposes, and to avoid generating multiple sections during interpretation of the document
                On the browser side, these tags must be grouped together. For this reason, HTML5 provides the element<br><br>

                    hgroup: <br>
                        <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_9.png"><br>
                        Listing 1-17. Using the hgroup element.<br><br>
                

            
            
                        H tags must preserve their hierarchy, which means that
                        we must first declare the h1 tag, then use h2 for subtitles and so on. However, unlike
                            From previous versions of HTML, HTML5 lets us reuse H tags and build this hierarchy over and over again in each
                             document section. In the example in Listing 1-17, we added a caption and additional data to each message.
                             Headings and subheadings were grouped together using hgroup, thus recreating the h1 and h2 hierarchy.
                                 on each article element. IMPORTANT: The hgroup element is necessary when we have a title and subtitle or
                                     more H tags together in the same header. This element can contain only H tags and this was the reason
                                     which is why in our example we leave the additional data out. <br><br>
                         
                                     If you only have an h1 tag or the
                                     h1 tag along with additional data, you don't have to group these elements together. For example, in the
                                         body header (header) we do not use this element because we only have an H tag inside it.
                                             Always remember that hgroup was created only with the intention of grouping H tags, exactly
                                                 As the name implies.<br><br>

                                                 Browsers and programs that run and display websites read the HTML code and create their own internal structure.
                                                 to interpret and process each element. This internal structure is divided into sections that have nothing to do with the
                                                 divisions in the layout or the section element. These are conceptual sections generated during code interpretation.
                                                     The header element does not create one of these sections by itself, which means that the elements within the header
                                                         they will represent different levels and internally they can generate different sections. <br><br>
          
                                                         The hgroup element was created with
                                                         the purpose of grouping the H tags and avoiding incorrect interpretations by browsers. Concepts
                                                         basics: what we call “additional information” inside the header in our previous description is known as
                                                         Metadata. Metadata is a set of data that describes and provides information about another set of data. In our
                                                         For example, Metadata is the date each message was posted. <br><br>
                            
                            

              <span class="tito"> - figure and figcaption :</span><br>
              The figure tag was created to help us be even more specific when declaring the content of the document.
              Before this element was introduced, we could not identify the content that was part of the information but
              at the same time independent, such as illustrations, photos, videos, etc… Normally these elements are part of the relevant content
               but they can be extracted or moved elsewhere without affecting or interrupting the flow of the document. When we meet
               With this kind of information, figure tags can be used to identify it: <br><br>
                    <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_10.png"><br>
                    Listing 1-18. Using the figure and figcaption elements.<br><br>
        
                    In Listing 1-18, in the first message, after the text we insert an image
                    . This is a common practice,
                    the text is often
                    enriched with images or videos. The labels appear
                     They allow us to wrap these visual complements and thus differentiate them from the most relevant information.
                      Also in Listing 1-18 you can see an extra element inside figure. Usually units
                          information such as images or videos are described with a short text below. HTML5 provides an element
                           to locate and identify these descriptive titles. The figcaption tags enclose the text related to
                                figure and establish a relationship between both elements and their content.<br><br>

            <p class="parami">

                Each part of the document is differentiated, declared and determined by specific tags.
                In this part of the chapter we are going to see how to build the global structure of an HTML document and the new
                 semantic elements built into HTML5.
                  
                  <br>First of all we need to indicate the type of document
                  what we are creating. This in HTML5 is extremely simple <br><br>

        
                 <span class="tito">-Using the element: </span> <br>

                 IMPORTANT: This line must be the first line of the file, with no spaces or lines preceding it.
                 In this way, the browser's standard mode is activated and HTML5 embeds are interpreted.
                 whenever possible, or ignored otherwise. Do it yourself: You can start copying the code
                 in your text file and add the next ones as we study them. After declaring the
                     document type, we need to start building the HTML structure. As always, the tree-like structure
                      of this language is rooted in the element . This element will wrap the rest of the code<br>


                            <span class="tito"> -Using the element: </span><br>



  The lang attribute in the opening html tag is the only attribute we need to specify in HTML5.
  This attribute defines the human language of the content of the document that we are creating, in this case it is Spanish.
   Basics: HTML uses a markup language to build web pages. These HTML tags are words
   key and attributes surrounded by greater than and less than signs (for example, html lang="en"). In this case, html is
       the keyword and lang is the attribute with the value is. Most HTML tags are used in pairs.
       an opening tag and a closing tag, and the content is declared between them. In our example,
        html lang="en" indicates the beginning of the HTML code and /html indicates the end. Compare opening tags
                       and close and you will see that the closing is distinguished by a backslash before the keyword (for example,
                       /html). The rest of our code will be inserted between these two tags:<br><br>
          
          
          <span class="tito"> -IMPORTANT:</span> <br>
          HTML5 is extremely flexible in terms of structure and elements used
          to build it. The html element can be included without any attributes or even completely ignored.
               For the purpose of preserving compatibility (and for some extra reasons not worth mentioning
 here) we recommend that you follow some basic rules. In this book we are going to teach you how to build
  HTML documents according to what we consider best practices. to find others
   languages ​​for the lang attribute you can visit the following link:
    <a style="color: blue;" href=" www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp</a>
    Let's continue building our template.<br>

    The embedded HTML code
    between tags has to be divided between two main sections.
         As in previous versions of HTML, the first section is the header and the second is the body.
          The next step, therefore, will be to create these two sections in the code using the elements
         already known. The head element comes first, of course, and like the rest
               of the structural elements has an opening tag and a closing tag:
                !DOCTYPE html html lang="en" head /head /html<br><br>
                      


                      <span class="tito">- Using the head element:</span>.<br>
        
        
                      The tag has not changed from previous versions and its purpose remains exactly the same.
                      Inside the head tags we will define the title of our web page, we will declare the set of
                           corresponding characters, we will provide general information about the document and incorporate the
                           external files with styles, Javascript codes or even images necessary to generate
                           the page on the screen. Except for the title and some icons, the rest of the information
                           embedded in the document between these tags is invisible to the user. body The next big
                                The section that is the main part of the organization of an HTML document is the body. The body represents
                                the visible part of every document and is specified between body tags. These labels have also not
                                     changed relative to previous versions of HTML: <br><br>
        !DOCTYPE html <br>
        html lang="es" <br>
        head <br>
        /head body <br>
        /body /html <br><br>
        
        
        . Using the body element. Basics: So far we have a simple code but
        with a complex structure. This is because HTML code is not made up of a set of instructions.
         sequential. HTML is a markup language, a list of elements that are usually used in pairs
         and that they can be nested (fully contained one inside the other). In the first line of the code<br><br>
              
              
              <span class="tito">-we have a simple label:</span><br>  
              with the definition of the document type and immediately after the
              html opening tag lang="en". This tag and the closing /html tag at the end of the listing are
              indicating the beginning of the HTML code and its end. Between the html tags we insert other tags
                  specifying two important parts of the basic structure: head for the header and body for
                      the body of the document. These two tags are also used in pairs. later in this
                      chapter we will see that more labels are inserted between the latter forming a structure
                      tree with html as its root.
        
        
        
                      meta It's time to build the document header. Some changes and innovations were
                      embedded within the header, and one of them is the tag that defines the character set
                      to use to display the document. This is a meta tag that specifies how the text will be
                      displayed on screen:<br><br>

          !DOCTYPE html <br>
         html lang="es"<br>
         head<br>
         meta charset=”iso-8859-1” /head <br>
        body /body <br>
        /html<br><br>
        
        <span class="tito">-Using the meta element: </span><br>
        The innovation of this element in HTML5, as in most cases,
        it's just simplification. The new meta tag for character type definition is shorter and
         simple. Of course, we can change the iso-8859-1 type to the one needed for our documents and add
         other meta tags such as description or keywords to define other aspects of the web page, as shown
         in the following example: <br><br>
        !DOCTYPE html> html lang="es"<br>
        head> <br>
        meta charset="iso-8859-1"> meta name=”description” content=”Ejemplo de HTML5” <br>
        meta name=”keywords” content=”HTML5, CSS3, Javascript” /head <br>
    body> <br>
        /body> <br>
        /html> <br><br>
        
        <span class="tito">- Adding more meta elements. Basic concepts: </span>  <br>
        There are several types of meta tag that can
        be included to declare general information about the document, but this information is not displayed
        in the browser window, it's only important for search engines and devices that need to do
        preview the document or get a summary of the information it contains. as we comment
        
        
        
        above, apart from the title and some icons, most of the information inserted between the
        head tags is not visible to users. <br><br>

            
            <span class="tito">-  the name attribute inside the meta tag: </span><br>
            specifies its type and content declares its value, but neither of these values ​​is displayed
            onscreen. To learn more about the meta tag, visit our website and follow the links
            provided for this chapter. <br>
            In HTML5 it is not necessary to close simple tags with a trailing slash,
            but we recommend using them for compatibility reasons. The above code could be written as
            Following way: <br><br>

            !DOCTYPE html><br>
             html lang="es"><br>
         head> <br>
        meta charset="iso-8859-1" /> <br>
    meta name="description" content="Ejemplo de HTML5" /> <br>
        meta name="keywords" content="HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript" /> <br>
        /head><br>
         body> /body> <br>
        /html> <br><br>
        
        . Cierre de etiquetas simples. title> La etiqueta /title>, como siempre, simplemente especifica el título del
 documento, y no hay nada nuevo para comentar:<br><br>
  !DOCTYPE html> <br>
  html lang="es"<br>
       head> <br>
           meta charset="iso-8859-1"<br>
        meta name="description" content="Ejemplo de HTML5" <br>
        meta name="keywords" content="HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript"<br>
            title Este texto es el título del documento /title <br>
        /head<br>
         body /body<br>
         /html <br><br>
        
        
         <span class="tito">-Using the title tag:</span><br>
         Basic concepts: The text between the title tags is the title of the document we are creating.
         Normally this text is displayed in the top bar of the browser window.
         link Another important element that goes inside the document header is link.
         This element is used to incorporate styles, Javascript codes, images or icons from
         external files. One of the most common uses for link is to embed files with CSS styles: <br><br>

        !DOCTYPE html<br>
        html lang="es"<br>
        head<br>
        meta charset="iso-8859-1"<br>
        meta name="description" content="Ejemplo de HTML5" <br>
        meta name="keywords" content="HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript"<br>
        title Este texto es el título del documento /title <br>
        link rel=”stylesheet” href=”misestilos.css” <br>
        /head <br>
        body /body <br>
        /html<br><br>
        
        <span class="tito">-Using the link element:</span><br>
        In HTML5 we no longer need to specify what kind of styles we are
        inserting, so the type attribute was removed. We only need two attributes to incorporate
        our style file: rel and href. The rel attribute means "relationship" and is about the relationship between
         the document and the file that we are incorporating through href. In this case, the rel attribute has the
         stylesheet value that tells the browser that the mystyles.css file is a CSS file with required styles
         to present the page on the screen (in the next chapter we will study how to use CSS styles).
         Basics: A styles file is a group of formatting rules that will help change the
          appearance of our website (for example, the size and color of the text).<br>
          Without these rules, the
          text and any other HTML elements would be displayed on the screen using the standard styles provided
           by the browser. Styles are simple rules that typically require only a few lines of code.
            and can be declared in the same document. As we will see later, it is not strictly necessary
            get this information from external files but it is a best practice. Load CSS rules from
            an external document (another file) will allow us to organize the document
       
       
       main, increase the loading speed and take advantage of the new features of HTML5.
       With this last insertion we can consider finished our work in the header. Now is the time
       to work on the body, where the magic happens...

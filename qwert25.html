            <p class="parami">
           
                


                One of the most mentioned features of HTML5 was the ability to render video. The enthusiasm had nothing to do with the new
                tools provided by HTML5 for this purpose, but rather with the fact that since the videos became an essential piece
                of the Internet, everyone expected native support from browsers. It was like everyone knew the importance of videos except
                 those in charge of developing the technologies for the web.<br><br> But now that we have native support for videos and even a
                  standard that will allow us to create cross-browser compatible video processing applications, we can understand that
                  the situation was much more complicated than we had imagined. From encoders to resource consumption, the reasons
                  to not implement video natively in browsers were much more complex than the code required to do so. A
                  Despite these complications, HTML5 finally introduced an element to insert and play video in an HTML document. The
                  video element uses opening and closing tags and only a few parameters to achieve its function. The syntax is
                      extremely simple and only the src attribute is required:<br>  <br>  




       <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_56.png"><br> 
       Listing 5-1. Basic syntax for the video element.<br> <br>

       In theory, the code in Listing 5-1 should be more than enough. I repeat, in theory. But as we explained earlier, things are
        they get a little more complicated in real life. First we must provide at least two different files with different video formats:
         OGG and MP4. This is because although the video element and its attributes are standard, there is no standard video format.
             First, some browsers support a video encoder that others don't, and second, the encoder used in the MP4 format (the
              only supported by major browsers such as Safari and Internet Explorer) is under a commercial license. The OGG Formats
               and MP4 are containers for video and audio. OGG contains Theora video and Vorbis audio encoders, and those available for the
                MP4 container are H.264 for video and AAC for audio. Right now OGG is recognized by Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera,
                 while MP4 works on Safari, Internet Explorer and also Google Chrome.<br> <br> 
 

           <span class="tito">- The video element : </span> <br>
           Let's try to ignore these complications for a moment and enjoy the simplicity of the video element. This item offers several
                attributes to set its behavior and configuration. The width and height attributes, just like in other HTML elements already
                 known, declare the dimensions for the player element or window. The size of the video will be automatically adjusted
                 to enter within these values, but they were not considered to resize the video but to limit the area occupied by the
                 same to maintain consistency in the design. The src attribute specifies the source of the video. This attribute can be overridden
                 by the source element and its own src attribute to declare multiple
                 fonts with different formats, as in the following example:<br> <br> 

      <img class="imgofcontenido" src="fotos/fm_57.png"><br> 
      Listing 5-2. Video player with default controls and compatible with HTML5 browsers.<br> <br>

      In Listing 5-2, the video element was expanded. Now inside the element tags are two source elements. these new
          elements provide different video sources for browsers to choose from. The browser will read the source tag and decide
          which file to play according to the supported formats (MP4 or OGG).<br>  <br>  




  <strong> Do it yourself :</strong><br>   Create a new empty HTML file named video.html (or any other name you like),
  copy the code
     in Listing 5-2, and open the file in different browsers to see how the video element works in each.
         one of them. <br>  <br>  



         <span class="tito">-  Attributes for video : </span> <br>
        
         We included an attribute on the video tag in Listings 5-1 and 5-2 that probably caught your attention. The
              controls attribute is one of several attributes available for this element. This one, in particular, shows
               video controls provided by the default browser. When the attribute is present each browser
                will activate its own interface, allowing the user to start playing the video, pause it or skip forward.
                 a specific box, among other functions. Along with controls, we can also use the following: <br>  <br> 
           



<span class="tito">- Autoplay : </span> <br>
  
When this attribute is present, the browser will automatically start playing the video as soon as it can.<br> <br>

<span class="tito">- loop : </span> <br>

If this attribute is specified, the browser will start playing the video again when it reaches the end.<br> <br>


<span class="tito">- poster : </span> <br>

This attribute is used to provide an image that will be displayed while we wait for the video to start playing. <br> <br>

<span class="tito">- preload : </span> <br>

This attribute can receive three different values: none, metadata or auto. The first indicates that the video is not
should be cached, usually for the purpose of minimizing unnecessary traffic. The second value, metadata, will recommend to the browser
that tries to capture information about the source (for example, dimensions, duration, first frame, etcâ€¦). The third value, auto, is
the default value that will prompt the browser to download the file as soon as possible. <br> <br>

  Listing 5-3: Leveraging the attributes of the video element. <br> <br>

  In Listing 5-3, the video element was populated with attributes. Due to differences in behavior between a browser and
       other, some attributes will be enabled or disabled by default, and some of them won't even work in some
        browsers or under certain circumstances. To get full control over the video element and the media played,
             we will have to program our own video player in Javascript taking advantage of the new methods, properties and
             built-in events in HTML5.<br> <br>

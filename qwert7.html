            <p class="parami">


                In our template we use h1 and h2 elements to declare titles and subtitles for different sections of the document. The styles by
                default of these elements are always very far from what we want and also in HTML5 we can reconstruct the H hierarchy several
                times in each section (as we learned in the previous chapter). The h1 element, for example, will be used several times in the document,
                     not only for the main title of the web page as it happened before but also for internal sections, so we have
                     to give it the appropriate styles:<br><br>
                      h1 { font: bold 20px verdana, sans-serif; } <br>
                      h2 { font: bold 14px verdana, sans-serif; } <br>
                     Listing 2-27. Adding styles for the h1 and h2 elements.<br><br>
            The font property, assigned to the h1 and h2 elements in Listing 2-27, allows us to declare all the styles for the text in one font.
                single line. The properties that can be declared using font are: font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size/line-height,
                 and font-family in this order. With these rules we are changing the thickness, size and font of the text inside the elements
                 h1 and h2 to the values ​​we want. <br><br>
 

              


        
                 <span class="tito">-  Declaring new HTML5 elements : </span> <br>
                

                 Another basic rule that we must declare from the beginning is the default definition of HTML5 structural elements.
                 Some browsers do not yet recognize these elements or treat them as inline elements. we need to declare
                  the new HTML5 elements as block elements to ensure that they will be treated as is normally done with
                  div elements and thus build our box model: header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure,
                      figcaption, hgroup{ display: block; } Listing 2-28. Default rule for HTML5 structural elements.
                      From now on, the elements affected by the rule in Listing 2-28 will be positioned on top of each other unless
                      that we specify something different later.   <br><br>
                    
               
                   
                     <span class="tito">- Centering the body  :</span><br>

                      

                     The first element that is part of the box model is always body. Normally, for different design reasons,
                     the content of this element must be positioned horizontally. We must always specify the size of
                     this content, or a maximum size, for consistent layout across different configuration settings.
                     screen.<br><br>
                      body { text-align: center; }<br>
                      Listing 2-29. Centering the body.<br><br>
                       By default, the body tag
                         (like any other block element) has a width value set to 100%. This means that the
                         body will occupy the full width of the browser window. Therefore, to center the page on the
                         screen we need to center the content within the body. With the added rule in Listing 2-29, everything
                 inside body will be centered in the window, thus centering the entire web page. <br><br>
                      
           
   
        
         <span class="tito">-Creating the main box :</span><br>

         
         Continuing with the design of our template, we must specify a size or maximum size for the body content.
         As you may remember, in Listing 2-25 earlier in this chapter we added a div element to the template to group
             all the boxes inside the body. <br><br>This div will be considered the main box for the construction of our model
                 box (this is the purpose for which we added it). In this way, modifying the size of this element we do it by
                 same time for everyone else: <br><br>
                 #group { width: 960px; margin: 15px auto; text-align: left; }<br>
                  Listing 2-30. Defining the properties of the main box.<br><br>
                   The rule in Listing 2-30 is first referencing an element through
                  of the value of its id attribute. The # character is telling the browser that the element affected by this set of
                  styles has the id attribute with the value group. This rule provides three styles for the main box. the first style
                  sets a fixed value of 960 pixels. This box will always have a width of 960 pixels, which represents a common value.
                  for a website these days (the values ​​are between 960 and 980 pixels wide, however these parameters
                  they change constantly over time, of course). The second style is part of what we call the Box Model
                  Traditional.<br><br>In the previous rule (Listing 2-29), we specified that the content of the body would be centered horizontally.
                  with the style text-align: center. But this only affects inline content, such as text or images. For block elements,
                   as a div, we need to set a specific value for its margins that automatically scales them to the size of
                        its parent element. The margin property used for this purpose can have four values: top, right,
                        bottom, left, in that order. This means that the first value declared in the style represents the margin
                        from the top of the element, the second is the right margin, and so on.<br><br> However, if
                         we only write the first two parameters, the rest will take the same values. In our example we are using
                         this technique. In Listing 2-30, the style margin: 15px auto assigns 15 pixels to the top and bottom margin of the
                         div element that is affecting and declares as automatic the size of the left and right margins
                              (the two declared values ​​are used to define the four margins). In this way, we will have generated
                               a space of 15<br><br>

                               pixels at the top and bottom of the body and the spaces to the sides (left and right margin) will be calculated
                               automatically according to the size of the document body and div element, effectively centering the content on screen.
                                   The web page is already centered and has a fixed size of 960 pixels. The next thing we need to do is prevent a problem
                                   That happens in some browsers. The text-align property is inheritable. This means that all elements within the
                                   body and its content will be centered, not just the main box. The style assigned to <body> in Listing 2-29 will be assigned
                                       to each of their children. We must return this style to its default value for the rest of the document. the third and
                                        The last built-in style in the rule in Listing 2-30 (text-align: left) accomplishes this purpose. The end result is
                                        that the content of the body is centered but the content of the main box (the div identified as grouping)
                                            is again left-aligned, so all other HTML inside this box inherits
                                            this style.<br><br>
          
    
                    
       

       <strong>Do it yourself :</strong> <br>  If you haven't already done so, copy each of the rules listed up to this point into a
       empty text file named mystyles.css. This file must be located in the same directory (folder) as the HTML file
       with the code in Listing 2-25. When finished, you should have two files, one with the HTML code and another called mystyles.css
       with all the CSS styles studied from Listing 2-26. Open the HTML file in your browser and on the screen you can see the
       created box. <br><br>
